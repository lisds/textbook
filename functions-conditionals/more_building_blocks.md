# More building blocks

We have already covered some important parts of programming for data science,
such as [expressions](../code-basics/Expressions),
[variables](../code-basics/variables), [data types](../data-types/data_types),
[arrays](../arrays/Arrays) and [data frames](../data-frames/data_frame_intro).

In this section, you cover the last two building blocks you will need as
a foundation for your future analyses.

These are:

- [Writing functions](functions)
- [Conditional statements](conditional_statements)
