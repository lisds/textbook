# Data frames

Many forms of data can be organized into _data tables_. Data tables are often
called _data frames_.

A _data table_ or _data frame_ has rows and columns.

The rows may represent _observations_, such as people in a clinical trial, or
sports teams. The columns represent _variables_ - each variable is some type
of information about the _observations_. For example, if the observations are
people in a clinical trial, the variables might be age, height, weight and
severity of disease. For a sports teams, they might be name, home city, number
of games played, number games lost, won and drawn.

You can think of data frames as a sequence of columns of data, where each column has the values for one variable.
