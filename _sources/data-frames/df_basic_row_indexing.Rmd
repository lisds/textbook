# Selecting rows from DataFrames

```{python}
# Load the Pandas data science library, call it 'pd'
import pandas as pd
# Turn on a setting to use Pandas more safely.
# We will discuss this setting later.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)

# Load the library for plotting, name it 'plt'
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Make plots look a little more fancy
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```

We return again to the DataFrame we were working on in [basic column
indexing](df_basic_col_indexing.Rmd).

```{python}
# Original data frame before dropping missing values.
gender_data = pd.read_csv('gender_stats_min.csv')
labeled_gdata = gender_data.dropna().set_index('country_code')
# Show the result
labeled_gdata
```

Thus far we have used DataFrame indexing to select columns from DataFrames.

Remember, *indexing* is where we use square brackets following a value in order
to select data from inside that value.

We also often want to select rows from DataFrames.   You have already seen
the `.head` and `.tail` methods, for selecting rows.

This page covers a more general, and more useful way of selecting rows, using
*direct indexing with a Boolean Series* (DIBS).


## Direct indexing with a Boolean Series

We often want to select rows from the data frame that match some criterion.

For example, let us return to the problem of comparing richer and poorer
countries.   So far we have sorted the DataFrame with `.sort_values` and then
selected the first $n$ or last $n$ values, using `.head` and `.tail`.  But what
if we wanted to select the rows corresponding the countries with a GDP above
some threshold.

Here's are the GDP values as a Series.  We are using *direct indexing with
column labels* (DICL) on the DataFrame, to get the column as a Series:

```{python}
# Direct indexing with column labels (DICL).
gdp = labeled_gdata['gdp_us_billion']
gdp
```

Here's the histogram of GDP again:

```{python}
plt.hist(gdp)
```

Looking at the histogram, we could try 1000 (billion US dollars) as a threshold
to identify high GDP countries.

As you have found in the [Series are like arrays](series_like_arrays.Rmd) page,
Series are like arrays in many ways.  As you remember, if you do a comparison
on an array, you get a Boolean array, where each value in the Boolean array is
the `True` or `False` answer to the comparison question for the corresponding
element in the original array.  If you do a comparison on a Series, you get a
Boolean Series, where each value in the Series is the `True` or `False` answer
to the comparison question for the corresponding element in the original
Series.

For example, here we do a comparison on the `gdp` series, and we get a Boolean Series.

```{python}
gdp_gt_1000 = gdp > 1000
gdp_gt_1000
```

Notice that the Boolean Series has the same row labels (index) as the original
Series (here, `gdp`).

The Boolean Series is — a Series:

```{python}
type(gdp_gt_1000)
```

We can use this Boolean series to select rows from the DataFrame, by *Boolean
indexing* — *direct indexing with Boolean Series* (DIBS).

When we index using the Boolean Series inside the square brackets, it works
like as it does when we index an array with a Boolean array:

```{python}
rich_gender_data = labeled_gdata[gdp_gt_1000]
rich_gender_data
```

```{python}
type(rich_gender_data)
```

`rich_gender_data` is a new data frame, that is a subset of the original
`labeled_gdata` frame.  It contains only the rows where the GDP value is
greater than `1000` billion dollars.  Check the display of `rich_gender_data`
above to confirm that the values in the `gdp_us_billion` column are all greater
than `1000`.

We can do a scatter plot of GDP values against maternal mortality rate, and we
find again that, for rich countries, there is little relationship between GDP
and maternal mortality.

```{python}
plt.scatter(rich_gender_data['gdp_us_billion'],
            rich_gender_data['mat_mort_ratio'])
```
