# Ode to code

Computer languages like [Python](https://python.org) and
[R](https://r-project.org) are \- languages.

They express ideas.

Computer languages consist of series of _statements_. The statements define
actions to take on data in the memory of the computer, or the devices
connected to it, such as the network.

Statements also express the logic of when to do the actions.
They can express repeated actions or actions that are only
performed, if a condition is met.

There was a time in your academic life when you did not need
code, because the sets of steps you needed to do were so
repetitive and well understood, that someone could design
a simple graphical interface (GUI) o to express all the options
that you needed.

At least, it seemed that way. If you have not found out
already, graphical user interfaces can trip you up. They can
make you feel like you understand what you are doing, when you
do not. They make it easy to do many analysis steps, without
keeping track of what you are doing, so it is easy to make
mistakes, and hard to check what you did. Graphical interfaces
make easy things easy, but difficult things, impossible.

You will soon find that most work that is worth doing, is
difficult. If you want to do something interesting, that has
not been done before, you will often need code.

![GUIs and code](../images/gui_and_code.png)

We need code more than we did ten years ago, because we have
much more data, and the data is of many different types. If
you want to load the data into a form that you use, you will
need to move it around, rearrange it, fix it. You will be doing
a series of logical steps, and these steps are most clearly
expressed in code.

Put another way, [You can't do data science in
a GUI](https://asterisk.dynevor.org/you-cant-do-data-science-in-a-gui.html).

Luckily, coding can be [very
rewarding](https://asterisk.dynevor.org/joys-of-craft.html) in
terms of pleasure and profit.

We are not the only ones who know we need code. Many people, including many
scientists, have been working on languages and libraries and tools, to make our
coding life simpler, clearer, and more efficient.

You will be learning some of the main tools and libraries on this course.
